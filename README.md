# Overview

This project is a **TypeScript Study Tracker** that demonstrates core TypeScript features in a simple console application.  
It uses classes, arrays, recursion, asynchronous functions, and exception handling to simulate tracking small study sessions.

The application:

- Prints study sessions and summaries to the terminal.
- Uses a `StudySession` class to model each session.
- Calculates total minutes with a recursive function.
- Loads extra sessions asynchronously.
- Demonstrates throwing and handling exceptions.
